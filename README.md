## Zelda One Randomizer for All (ZORA) 

ZORA is an open-source item randomizer for Zelda 1 written primarily by tetraly with contributions from other members of the Zelda 1 Randomizer community. It's intended to be a randomizer by and for all members of the community as opposed to being centrally controlled by a small number of people.

To create a randomized ROM, run: 
```
python3 zora.py --input_filename=[PATH TO VANILLA Z1 ROM] --seed=[SEED NUMBER]
```
